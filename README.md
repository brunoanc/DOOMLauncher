# DOOMLauncher

Launcher for DOOM (2016) that bypasses resource verification on startup.

NOTE: If you use the [latest DOOMModLoader release](https://github.com/ZwipZwapZapony/DOOMModLoader) with the 2024 game update, this isn't needed anymore: a patch with the same effect will be applied to the game executable by the modloader.

## Usage

Put "DOOMLauncher.exe" in your DOOM folder, then double click to run it.
